# <p align="center"><b>Using a Stepper Motor</b></p>
The [program](../code.ino "Program") shows how to use a Stepper Motor (28-BYJ48) with a motor controller (L298N).  
The [picture](../picture.png "Circuit") shows how to connect the cables properly.


Important Annotation: The Stepper Motor is designed for only 5V, otherwise it will get pretty hot and may brake.
